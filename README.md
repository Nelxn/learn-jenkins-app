# üöÄ Learn Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Docker & AWS Deployment

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps workflow where I automated the build, testing, containerization, and cloud deployment of a Node.js application using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **AWS EC2**. This project reflects a real-world CI/CD and deployment setup, similar to what DevOps engineers do in production environments.

---

## üì¶ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Fork a Node.js application from GitHub
- Dockerize the application for consistent builds
- Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate:
  - Building the app with dependencies
  - Testing the application
  - Building a Docker image
  - Pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub
  - Deploying the app to an AWS EC2 instance
- Securely expose the app on port `3000`

---

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools Used

- **Node.js 18** (Application runtime)
- **Docker** (Containerization)
- **Jenkins** (CI/CD Pipeline)
- **Docker Hub** (Image Registry)
- **AWS EC2** (Cloud Deployment)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)
- **AWS Security Groups** (Firewall for port access)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Application Setup
- Forked the `learn-jenkins-app` from GitHub.
- Wrote a production-ready **Dockerfile**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:18-slim
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package.json .
  RUN npm ci --only=production
  COPY . .
  EXPOSE 3000
  CMD ["npm", "start"]



This ensures:

Clean, lightweight image

Only production dependencies installed

Port 3000 exposed for the app

2. Jenkins Pipeline Setup
Created a Jenkins container from a Dockerfile hosted in my GitHub repository

Exposed Jenkins UI on port 8080

Linked the Jenkins pipeline to my forked project repository

3. Declarative Jenkins Pipeline with 5 Stages
The pipeline includes:

Stage	Description
Build	Installs project dependencies (npm ci)
Test	Runs application tests (placeholder or real tests)
Docker Build	Builds Docker image for the app
Docker Push	Pushes image to Docker Hub
Deploy	Pulls image on AWS EC2 and runs container
Post Actions	Echoes pipeline success or failure

4. Cloud Deployment to AWS EC2
Launched an EC2 instance (Linux)

Installed Docker on EC2

Pulled the latest app image from Docker Hub

Ran the container exposing port 3000

Configured AWS Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 3000
